    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Crafting the Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon with Port Wine Sauce demands
      meticulous attention to detail. Begin by selecting prime filet mignon
      cuts, ensuring they are trimmed to perfection. The steaks are then
      generously coated with a harmonious blend of blue cheese, breadcrumbs, and
      select herbs, creating a crust that will enhance the steak's natural
      succulence. The filet mignon is seared to a golden perfection, locking in
      the juices and creating a tantalizing contrast with the crispy blue cheese
      exterior. While the steaks rest, the chef prepares a velvety port wine
      sauce, reducing the wine to a luscious consistency that will complement
      the richness of the steak. Plated with artful precision, the Blue Cheese
      Crusted Filet Mignon is served with a generous drizzle of the port wine
      sauce, creating a culinary masterpiece that elevates the classic filet
      mignon to unparalleled heights of sophistication and flavor. Each forkful
      is a symphony of textures and tastes, making this dish a true indulgence
      for the connoisseur's palate.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      1 tablespoon butter
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ½ cup minced white onion
    </ul>
    <ul>
      3 cloves garlic, minced
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ¾ cup low-sodium beef broth
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ½ cup port wine
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 tablespoon vegetable oil
    </ul>
    <ul>
      4 filet mignon steaks (1 1/2 inch thick)
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ¾ cup crumbled blue cheese
    </ul>
    <ul>
      ¼ cup panko bread crumbs
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      1 Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and
      thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is tender. Stir in the beef
      broth, scraping any onion bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in
      the port wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the mixture has reduced to
      about 1/2 cup. Set aside. This may also be made ahead of time, and
      reheated.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      2 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a
      cast-iron or other oven-safe skillet over high heat. Sear steaks quickly
      on both sides until brown, then place the whole pan into the oven.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      3 Roast steaks in the oven for about 15 minutes for medium rare - with an
      internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). You may adjust this
      time to allow the steaks to finish just below your desired degree of
      doneness if medium is not what you prefer. Remove from the oven, and place
      on a baking sheet. Stir together the panko crumbs and blue cheese. Top
      each steak with a layer of this mixture.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      4 Preheat the oven's broiler. Place steaks under the preheated broiler
      until the cheese topping is browned and bubbly. 3 to 4 minutes. Remove
      from the oven, and let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve
      with warm port wine sauce.
    </ol>
