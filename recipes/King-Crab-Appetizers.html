    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The creation of the King Crab Cutlet is a meticulous dance of culinary
      artistry, starting with the selection of the finest king crab legs. The
      chef carefully extracts the succulent crab meat, ensuring each luscious
      strand is free from any impurities. To enhance the natural sweetness and
      flavor, a light seasoning is applied, allowing the essence of the king
      crab to shine. The delicate crab meat is then expertly formed into sizable
      cutlets, each one a testament to the chef's skill and precision. The
      preparation continues with a masterful coating process, where the crab
      cutlets are enveloped in a seasoned batter that guarantees a perfect
      balance of crispiness upon frying. The cutlets take a luxurious bath in
      bubbling golden oil, transforming into a visual and gustatory delight. The
      final touch involves a decadent lemon-infused butter sauce, drizzled
      artfully over the golden cutlets. This buttery elixir not only complements
      the sweet crab meat but also adds a touch of citrus brightness, creating a
      symphony of flavors that dance on the palate. The result is the King Crab
      Cutlet—a culinary masterpiece that captures the essence of indulgence and
      sophistication.
